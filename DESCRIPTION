Description: In medical research, supervised heterogeneity analysis has important implications. Assume that there are two types of features. Using both types of features, our goal is to conduct the first supervised heterogeneity analysis that satisfies a hierarchical structure. That is, the first type of features defines a rough structure, and the second type defines a nested and more refined structure. A penalization approach is developed, which has been motivated by but differs significantly from penalized fusion and sparse group penalization.
